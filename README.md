# Koppeltaal-Test-Game

How to use the TEST Game? 
1. There are two main modes: OAuth support and direct login. If using the OAuth support please provide the launch sequence in the browser URL. For direct login please contact koppeltaal support. Launch Sequence can be implemented as documented on Koppeltaal WIKI. 
2. Once logged on the proper server (TEST or ACC) you can get the CarePlan available for the given patient. 
3. With the CarePlan an Activity Status update can be posted (always request the Object before posting an Update!)
